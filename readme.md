# 3D Printed Articulated Finger Extensions

I really wanted a set of articulated finger extensions like the ones that Dragonator has posted [here](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Articulated-Finger-Extensions/), but none of his files suited my stubby little fingers. So here is my version, that's fully parametric.

Unless you want to start tweaking the code, all the settings you need are in prefs.scad. Use it to enter the measurements of your printer, and choose which part(s) you want to print. Then open finger.scad in OpenSCAD to render and print it.

Follow Dragonator's [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Articulated-Finger-Extensions/) to see which measurements you need, and how to assemble it. However, I recommend printing a piece at a time to see what's comfortable. Start with the first joint, then print the second, join them together and see if it's comfy. I found that my first efforts weren't right for the finger they were intended for, but worked for a different finger, so keep hold of your drafts.
